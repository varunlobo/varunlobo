### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am new to GitHub and I am here to showcase my interest in Data Science and related projects I plan to complete in the coming months.

I have over 10 yrs experience working in the automotive sector as a Mechanical Engineering and I love everything automotive. I've worked in various roles over these few years such as Project Manager, Customer Success, Custer Application Engineer, Development & testing engineer, Data & Analytics engineer etc.

I am currently expanding my knowledge in the field of DS and analytics and on a path of self-learning. 

If you have ideas, suggestions or advice for someone like me, or just want to say hi, please feel free to reach out.
